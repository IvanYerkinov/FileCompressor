               a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

               a vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.
               war drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls
               into infinity.

                    it is a period of civil war. rebel spaceships,
                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first
                    victory against the evil galactic empire.

                    during the battle, rebel spies managed to steal
                    secret plans to the empire's ultimate weapon, the
                    death star, an armored space station with enough
                    power to destroy an entire planet.

                    pursued by the empire's sinister agents, princess
                    leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of
                    the stolen plans that can save her people and
                    restore freedom to the galaxy...

               the awesome yellow planet of tatooine emerges from a total
               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. a tiny
               silver spacecraft, a rebel blockade runner firing lasers
               from the back of the ship, races through space. it is pursed
               by a giant imperial stardestroyer. hundreds of deadly
               laserbolts streak from the imperial stardestroyer, causing
               the main solar fin of the rebel craft to disintegrate.

               int. rebel blockade runner - main passageway

               an explosion rocks the ship as two robots, artoo-detoo (r2-
               d2) and see-threepio (c-3po) struggle to make their way
               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. both robots are
               old and battered. artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. his
               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
               threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of
               human proportions. he has a gleaming bronze-like metallic
               surface of an art deco design.

               another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

                                     threepio
                         did you hear that? they've shut down
                         the main reactor. we'll be destroyed
                         for sure. this is madness!

               rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in
               the main passageway. they aim their weapons toward the door.

                                     threepio
                         we're doomed!

               the little r2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
               only another robot could understand.

                                     threepio
                         there'll be no escape for the princess
                         this time.

               artoo continues making beeping sounds. tension mounts as
               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment
               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.

                                     threepio
                         what's that?

               ext. spacecraft in space

               the imperial craft has easily overtaken the rebel blockade
               runner. the smaller rebel ship is being drawn into the
               underside dock of the giant imperial starship.

               int. rebel blockade runner

               the nervous rebel troopers aim their weapons. suddenly a
               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and
               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make
               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.

               in a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
               laserfire. the deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
               creating huge explosions. stormtroopers scatter and duck
               behind storage lockers. laserbolts hit several rebel soldiers
               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
               arms and faces.

               an explosion hits near the robots.

                                     threepio
                         i should have known better than to
                         trust the logic of a half-sized
                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...

               artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
               around the two hapless robots.

               ext. tatooine - desert wasteland - day

               a death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
               the tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone
               figure, luke skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations
               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. his shaggy
               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable
               lad with a prize-winning smile.

               a light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. he is aided
               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. the little robot
               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.
               a bright sparkle in the morning sky catches luke's eye and
               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his
               utility belt. he stands transfixed for a few moments studying
               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired
               landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet
               above the ground on a magnetic-field). he motions for the
               tiny robot to follow him.

                                     luke
                         hurry up! come with me! what are you
                         waiting for?! get in gear!

               the robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. luke throws his
               arms up in disgust. exasperated, the young farm boy jumps
               into his landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum
               madly.

               int. rebel blockade runner - main hallway

               the awesome, seven-foot-tall dark lord of the sith makes his
               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. this is
               darth vader, right hand of the emperor. his face is obscured
               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which
               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the
               imperial stormtroopers. everyone instinctively backs away
               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through
               the rebel troops. several of the rebel troops break and run
               in a frenzied panic.

               int. rebel blockade runner

               a woman's hand puts a card into an opening in artoo's dome.
               artoo makes beeping sounds.

               int. rebel blockade runner

               threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. artoo is
               nowhere in sight. the pitiful screams of the doomed rebel
               soldiers can be heard in the distance.

                                     threepio
                         artoo! artoo-detoo, where are you?

               a familiar clanking sound attacks threepio's attention and
               he spots little artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
               filled alcove. a beautiful young girl (about sixteen years
               old) stands in front of artoo. surreal and out of place,
               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting
               something on artoo's computer face, then watches as the little
               robot joins his companion.

                                     threepio
                         at last! where have you been?

               stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.

                                     threepio
                         they're heading in this direction.
                         what are we going to do? we'll be
                         sent to the spice mine of kessel or
                         smashed into who knows what!

               artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the
               subhallway. threepio chases after him.

                                     threepio
                         wait a minute, where are you going?

               artoo responds with electronic beeps.

               int. rebel blockade runner - corridor

               the evil darth vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies
               of his foes. he grabs a wounded rebel officer by the neck as
               an imperial officer rushes up to the dark lord.

                                     imperial officer
                         the death star plans are not in the
                         main computer.

               vader squeezes the neck of the rebel officer, who struggles
               in vain.

                                     vader
                         where are those transmissions you
                         intercepted?

               vader lifts the rebel off his feet by his throat.

                                     vader
                         what have you done with those plans?

                                     rebel officer
                         we intercepted no transmissions.
                         aaah... this is a consular ship.
                         were on a diplomatic mission.

                                     vader
                         if this is a consular ship... were
                         is the ambassador?

               the rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the
               dark lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a
               gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
               vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to
               his troops.

                                     vader
                         commander, tear this ship apart until
                         you've found those plans and bring
                         me the ambassador. i want her alive!

               the stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.

               int. rebel blockade runner - subhallway

               the lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the
               stormtroopers search through the ship. she is princess leia
               organa, a member of the alderaan senate. the fear in her
               eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds
               of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. one of the
               troopers spots her.

                                     trooper
                         there she is! set for stun!

               leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with
               her laser pistol. she starts to run but is felled by a
               paralyzing ray. the troopers inspect her inert body.

                                     trooper
                         she'll be all right. inform lord
                         vader we have a prisoner.

               int. rebel blockade runner - subhallway

               artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.
               he snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light
               begins to flash. the stubby astro-robot works his way into
               the cramped four-man pod.

                                     threepio
                         hey, you're not permitted in there.
                         it's restricted. you'll be deactivated
                         for sure..

               artoo beeps something to him.

                                     threepio
                         don't call me a mindless philosopher,
                         you overweight glob of grease! now
                         come out before somebody sees you.

               artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding
               the mission he is about to perform.

                                     threepio
                         secret mission? what plans? what are
                         you talking about? i'm not getting
                         in there!

               artoo isn't happy with threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps
               and twangs angrily.

               a new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris
               through the narrow subhallway. flames lick at threepio and,
               after a flurry of electronic swearing from artoo, the lanky
               robot jumps into the lifepod.

                                     threepio
                         i'm going to regret this.

               int. imperial stardestroyer

               on the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified
               robots speeds away from the stricken rebel spacecraft.

                                     chief pilot
                         there goes another one.

                                     captain
                         hold your fire. there are no life
                         forms. it must have been short-
                         circuited.

               int. lifepod

               artoo and threepio look out at the receding imperial starship.
               stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.

                                     threepio
                         that's funny, the damage doesn't
                         look as bad from out here.

               artoo beeps an assuring response.

                                     threepio
                         are you sure this things safe?

               ext. tatooine - anchorhead settlement - power station - day

               heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white
               buildings. luke pilots his landspeeder through the dusty
               empty street of the tiny settlement. an old woman runs to
               get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist
               at luke as he flies past.

                                     woman
                         i've told you kids to slow down!

               int. power station - day

               luke bursts into the power station, waking the fixer, a rugged
               mechanic and camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been
               asleep in his lap. they grumbled as he races through the
               office, yelling wildly.

                                     fixer
                         did i hear a young noise blast through
                         here?

                                     camie
                         it was just wormie on another rampage.

               luke bounces into a small room behind the office where deak
               and windy, two tough boys about the same age as luke, are
               playing a computer pool-like game with biggs, a burly,
               handsome boy a few years older than the rest. his flashy
               city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics
               of the farm boys. a robot repairs some equipment in the
               background.

                                     luke
                         shape it up you guys!... biggs?

               luke's surprise at the appearance of biggs gives way to great
               joy and emotion. they give each other a great bear hug.

                                     luke
                         i didn't know you were back! when
                         did you get in?

                                     biggs
                         just now. i wanted to surprise you,
                         hot shot. i thought you'd be here...
                         certainly didn't expect you to be
                         out working.
                              (he laughs)

                                     luke
                         the academy didn't change you
                         much...but you're back so soon? hey,
                         what happened, didn't you get your
                         commission?

               biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.

                                     biggs
                         of course i got it. signed aboard
                         the rand ecliptic last week. first
                         mate biggs darklighter at your
                         service...
                              (he salutes)
                         ...i just came to say good-bye to
                         all you unfortunate landlocked
                         simpletons.

               everyone laughs. the dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend
               is almost too much for luke, but suddenly he snaps out of
               it.

                                     luke
                         i almost forgot. there's a battle
                         going on! right here in our system.
                         come and look!

                                     deak
                         not again! forget it.

               day

               the group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. camie
               and the fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes.
               luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.

                                     luke
                         there they are!

               biggs takes the binoculars from luke as the others strain to
               see something with the naked eye. through the binoculars
               biggs sees two small silver specks.

                                     biggs
                         that's no battle, hot shot... they're
                         just sitting there! probably a
                         freighter-tanker refueling.

                                     luke
                         but there was a lot of firing
                         earlier...

               camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the
               building in the process. luke grabs them.

                                     luke
                         hey, easy with those...

                                     camie
                         don't worry about it, wormie.

               the fixer gives luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs
               his shoulders in resignation.

                                     fixer
                         i keep telling you, the rebellion is
                         a long way from here. i doubt if the
                         empire would even fight to keep this
                         system. believe me luke, this planet
                         is a big hunk of nothing...

               luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. the
               group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about
               luke's ineptitude.

               int. rebel blockade runner - hallway

               princess leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad
               of armored stormtroopers. her hands are bound and she is
               brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly
               marching troops. they stop in a smoky hallway as darth vader
               emerges from the shadows. the sinister dark lord stares hard
               at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.

                                     leia
                         lord vader, i should have known.
                         only you could be so bold. the
                         imperial senate will not sit for
                         this, when they hear you've attacked
                         a diplomatic...

                                     vader
                         don't play games with me, your
                         highness. you weren't on any mercy
                         mission this time. you passed directly
                         through a restricted system. several
                         transmissions were beamed to this
                         ship by rebel spies. i want to know
                         what happened to the plans they sent
                         you.

                                     leia
                         i don't know what you're talking
                         about. i'm a member of the imperial
                         senate on a diplomatic mission to
                         alderaan...

                                     vader
                         you're a part of the rebel alliance...
                         and a traitor. take her away!

               leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering
               hole blasted in the side of the ship. an imperial commander
               turns to vader.

                                     commander
                         holding her is dangerous. if word of
                         this gets out, it could generate
                         sympathy for the rebellion in the
                         senate.

                                     vader
                         i have traced the rebel spies to
                         her. now she is my only link to find
                         their secret base!

                                     commander
                         she'll die before she tells you
                         anything.

                                     vader
                         leave that to me. send a distress
                         signal and then inform the senate
                         that all aboard were killed!

               another imperial officer approaches vader and the commander.
               they stop and snap to attention.

                                     second officer
                         lord vader, the battle station plans
                         are not aboard this ship! and no
                         transmissions were made. an escape
                         pod was jettisoned during the
                         fighting, but no life forms were
                         aboard.

               vader turns to the commander.

                                     vader
                         she must have hidden the plans in
                         the escape pod. send a detachment
                         down to retrieve them. see to it
                         personally, commander. there'll be
                         no one to stop us this time.

                                     commander
                         yes, sir.

               the imperial stardestroyer comes over the surface of the
               planet tatooine.

               ext. tatooine - desert

               jundland, or "no man's land", where the rugged desert mesas
               meet the foreboding dune sea. the two helpless astro-droids
               kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily
               work their way across the desert wasteland. the lifepod in
               the distance rests half buried in the sand.

                                     threepio
                         how did i get into this mess? i really
                         don't know how. we seem to be made
                         to suffer. it's our lot in life.

               artoo answers with beeping sounds.

                                     threepio
                         i've got to rest before i fall apart.
                         my joints are almost frozen.

               artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.

                                     threepio
                         what a desolate place this is.

               suddenly artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts
               off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. threepio
               stops and yells at him.

                                     threepio
                         where are you going?

               a stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small
               robot.

                                     threepio
                         well, i'm not going that way. it's
                         much too rocky. this way is much
                         easier.

               artoo counters with a long whistle.

                                     threepio
                         what makes you think there are
                         settlements over there?

               artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     threepio
                         don't get technical with me.

               artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     threepio
                         what mission? what are you talking
                         about? i've had just about enough of
                         you! go that way! you'll be
                         malfunctioning within a day, you
                         nearsighted scrap pile!

               threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the
               direction of the vast dune sea.

                                     threepio
                         and don't let me catch you following
                         me begging for help, because you
                         won't get it.

               artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. he turns and trudges
               off in the direction of the towering mesas.

                                     threepio
                         no more adventures. i'm not going
                         that way.

               artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant
               mountains.

               ext. tatooine - dune sea

               threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a
               dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless
               miles.  he looks back in the direction of the now distant
               rock mesas.

                                     threepio
                         that malfunctioning little twerp.
                         this is all his fault! he tricked me
                         into going this way, but he'll do no
                         better.

               in a huff of anger and frustration, threepio knocks the sand
               from his joints. his plight seems hopeless, when a glint of
               reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving
               towards him.

                                     threepio
                         wait, what's that? a transport! i'm
                         saved!

               the bronze android waves frantically and yells at the
               approaching transport.

                                     threepio
                         over here! help! please, help!

               luke and biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. fixer
               and the others can be heard working inside.

                              (very animated)
                         ...so i cut off my power, shut down
                         the afterburners and came in low on
                         deak's trail. i was so close i thought
                         i was going to fry my instruments.
                         as it was i busted up the skyhopper
                         pretty bad. uncle owen was pretty
                         upset. he grounded me for the rest
                         of the season. you should have been
                         there... it was fantastic.

                                     biggs
                         you ought to take it easy luke. you
                         may be the hottest bushpilot this
                         side of mos eisley, but those little
                         skyhoppers are dangerous. keep it
                         up, and one day, whammo, you're going
                         to be nothing more than a dark spot
                         on the down side of a canyon wall.

                                     luke
                         look who's talking. now that you've
                         been around those giant starships
                         you're beginning to sound like my
                         uncle. you've gotten soft in the
                         city...

                         i've missed you kid.

                                     luke
                         well, things haven't been the same
                         since you left, biggs. it's been
                         so... quiet.

               biggs looks around then leans close to luke.

                         luke, i didn't come back just to say
                         good-bye... i shouldn't tell you
                         this, but you're the only one i can
                         trust... and if i don't come back, i
                         want somebody to know.

               luke's eyes are wide with biggs' seriousness and loyalty.

                                     luke
                         what are you talking about?

                                     biggs
                         i made some friends at the academy.
                              (he whispers)
                         ...when our frigate goes to one of
                         the central systems, we're going to
                         jump ship and join the alliance...

               luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.

                                     luke
                         join the rebellion?! are you kidding!
                         how?

                                     biggs
                         quiet down will ya! you got a mouth
                         bigger than a meteor crater!

                                     luke
                         i'm sorry. i'm quiet.
                              (he whispers)
                         listen how quiet i am. you can barely
                         hear me...

               biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.

                                     biggs
                         my friend has a friend on bestine
                         who might help us make contact.

                                     luke
                         you're crazy! you could wander around
                         forever trying to find them.

                                     biggs
                         i know it's a long shot, but if i
                         don't find them i'll do what i can
                         on my own... it's what we always
                         talked about. luke, i'm not going to
                         wait for the empire to draft me into
                         service. the rebellion is spreading
                         and i want to be on the right side --
                         the side i believe in.

                                     luke
                         and i'm stuck here...

                                     biggs
                         i thought you were going to the
                         academy next term. you'll get your
                         chance to get off this rock.

                                     luke
                         not likely! i had to cancel my
                         application. there has been a lot of
                         unrest among the sandpeople since
                         you left... they've even raided the
                         outskirts of anchorhead.

                                     biggs
                         your uncle could hold off a whole
                         colony of sandpeople with one blaster.

                                     luke
                         i know, but he's got enough vaporators
                         going to make the place pay off. he
                         needs me for just one more season. i
                         can't leave him now.

                                     biggs
                         i feel for you, luke, you're going
                         to have to learn what seems to be
                         important or what really is important.
                         what good is all your uncle's work
                         if it's taken over by the empire?...
                         you know they're starting to
                         nationalize commerce in the central
                         systems... it won't be long before
                         your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving
                         for the greater glory of the empire.

                                     luke
                         it couldn't happen here. you said it
                         yourself. the empire won't bother
                         with this rock.

                                     biggs
                         things always change.

                                     luke
                         i wish i was going... are you going
                         to be around long?

                                     biggs
                         no, i'm leaving in the morning...

                                     luke
                         then i guess i won't see you.

                                     biggs
                         maybe someday... i'll keep a lookout.

                                     luke
                         well, i'll be at the academy next
                         season... after that who knows. i
                         won't be drafted into the imperial
                         starfleet that's for sure... take
                         care of yourself, you'll always be
                         the best friend i've got.

                                     biggs
                         so long, luke.

               biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the
               power station.

               ext. tatooine - rock canyon - sunset

               the gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
               foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures
               fill the air. artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock
               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he
               goes. he hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for
               a moment. convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.

               in the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall
               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. a little
               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a
               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the
               narrow path.

               the unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until
               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out
               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. he manages
               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his
               back. his bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then
               off again. out of the rocks scurry three jawas, no taller
               than artoo. they holster strange and complex weapons as they
               cautiously approach the robot. they wear grubby cloaks and
               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be
               seen. they hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave
               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down
               the trail.

               ext. tatooine - rock canyon - sandcrawler - sunset

               the eight jawas carry artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. they weld a
               small disk on the side of artoo and then put him under a
               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot
               is sucked into the giant machine.

               the filthy little jawas scurry like rats up small ladders
               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.

               int. sandcrawler - hold area

               it is dim inside the hold area of the sandcrawler. artoo
               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles
               around the scrap heap. the narrow beam swings across rusty
               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and
               maimed astro-robots. he lets out a pathetic electronic whimper
               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end
               of the chamber.

               int. sandcrawler - prison area

               artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. in the
               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various
               shapes and sizes. some are engaged in electronic conversation,
               while others simply mill about. a voice of recognition calls
               out from the gloom.

                                     threepio
                         artoo-detoo! it's you! it's you!

               a battered threepio scrambles up to artoo and embraces him.

               ext. tatooine - rock canyon - sandcrawler - sunset

               the enormous sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent
               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain
               ridge.

               ext. tatooine - desert - day

               four imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
               buried lifepod that brought artoo and threepio to tatooine.
               a trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

                                     first trooper
                         someone was in the pod. the tracks
                         go off in this direction.

               a second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand
               and gives it to the first trooper.

                                     second trooper
                         look, sir -- droids.

               ext. tatooine - dunes

               the sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.

               int. sandcrawler

               threepio and artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped
               prison chamber. artoo appears to be shut off.

                                     threepio
                         wake up! wake up!

               suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the sandcrawler stops,
               creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.
               threepio's fist bangs the head of artoo whose computer lights
               pop on as he begins beeping. at the far end of the long
               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding
               white light. a dozen or so jawas make their way through the
               odd assortment of robots.

                                     threepio
                         we're doomed.

               a jawa starts moving toward them.

                                     threepio
                         do you think they'll melt us down?

               artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

                                     threepio
                         don't shoot! don't shoot! will this
                         never end?

               ext. tatooine - desert - lars homestead - afternoon

               the jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their
               battered captives, including artoo and threepio, in front of
               the enormous sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small
               homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground
               surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small
               adobe block house.

               the jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening
               them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow.
               the shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting
               small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils
               should be.

               out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps owen lars,
               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. his reddish eyes are
               sunken in a dust-covered face. as the farmer carefully
               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump-
               shouldered nephew, luke skywalker. one of the vile little
               jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales
               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.

               a voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the
               homestead. luke goes over to the edge and sees his aunt beru
               standing in the main courtyard.

                                     beru
                         luke, tell owen that if he gets a
                         translator to be sure it speaks bocce.

                                     luke
                         it looks like we don't have much of
                         a choice but i'll remind him.

               luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment
               for sale with the jawa leader.

                                     owen
                         i have no need for a protocol droid.

                                     threepio
                              (quickly)
                         sir -- not in an environment such as
                         this -- that's why i've also been
                         programmed for over thirty secondary
                         functions that...

                                     owen
                         what i really need is a droid that
                         understands the binary language of
                         moisture vaporators.

                                     threepio
                         vaporators! sir -- my first job was
                         programming binary load lifter...
                         very similar to your vaporators. you
                         could say...

                                     owen
                         do you speak bocce?

                                     threepio
                         of course i can, sir. it's like a
                         second language for me... i'm as
                         fluent in bocce...

                                     owen
                         all right shut up!
                              (turning to jawa)
                         i'll take this one.

                                     threepio
                         shutting up, sir.

                                     owen
                         luke, take these two over to the
                         garage, will you? i want you to have
                         both of them cleaned up before dinner.

                                     luke
                         but i was going into toshi station
                         to pick up some power converters...

                                     owen
                         you can waste time with your friends
                         when your chores are done. now come
                         on, get to it!

                                     luke
                         all right, come on! and the red one,
                         come on. well, come on, red, let's
                         go.

               as the jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back
               into the sandcrawler, artoo lets out a pathetic little beep
               and starts after his old friend threepio. he is restrained
               by a slimy jawa, who zaps him with a control box.

               owen is negotiating with the head jawa. luke and the two
               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the
               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

                                     luke
                         uncle owen...

                                     owen
                         yeah?

                                     luke
                         this r2 unit has a bad motivator.
                         look!

                                     owen
                              (to the head jawa)
                         hey, what're you trying to push on
                         us?

               the jawa goes into a loud spiel. meanwhile, artoo has sneaked
               out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract
               attention. he lets out with a low whistle. threepio taps
               luke on the shoulder.

                                     threepio
                              (pointing to artoo)
                         excuse me, sir, but that r2 unit is
                         in prime condition. a real bargain.

                                     luke
                         uncle owen...

                                     owen
                         yeah?

                                     luke
                         what about that one?

                                     owen
                              (to jawa)
                         what about that blue one? we'll take
                         that one.

               with a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged
               astro-droid for artoo.

                                     luke
                         yeah, take it away.

                                     threepio
                         uh, i'm quite sure you'll be very
                         pleased with that one, sir. he really
                         is in first-class condition. i've
                         worked with him before. here he comes.

               owen pays off the whining jawa as luke and the two robots
               trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.

                                     luke
                         okay, let's go.

                                     threepio
                              (to artoo)
                         now, don't you forget this! why i
                         should stick my neck out for you is
                         quite beyond my capacity!

               int. lars homestead - garage area - late afternoon

               the garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful
               atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. threepio lowers
               himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. near the
               battered landspeeder little artoo rests on a large battery
               with a cord to his face.

                                     threepio
                         thank the maker! this oil bath is
                         going to feel so good. i've got such
                         a bad case of dust contamination, i
                         can barely move!

               artoo beeps a muffled reply. luke seems to be lost in thought
               as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man
               skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage.
               finally luke's frustrations get the better of him and he
               slams a wrench across the workbench.

                                     luke
                         it just isn't fair. oh, biggs is
                         right. i'm never gonna get out of
                         here!

                                     threepio
                         is there anything i might do to help?

               luke glances at the battered robot. a bit of his anger drains
               and a tiny smile creeps across his face.

                                     luke
                         well, not unless you can alter time,
                         speed up the harvest, or teleport me
                         off this rock!

                                     threepio
                         i don't think so, sir. i'm only a
                         droid and not very knowledgeable
                         about such things. not on this planet,
                         anyways. as a matter of fact, i'm
                         not even sure which planet i'm on.

                                     luke
                         well, if there's a bright center to
                         the universe, you're on the planet
                         that it's farthest from.

                                     threepio
                         i see, sir.

                                     luke
                         uh, you can call me luke.

                                     threepio
                         i see, sir luke.

                                     luke
                              (laughing)
                         just luke.

                                     threepio
                         and i am see-threepio, human-cyborg
                         relations, and this is my counterpart,
                         artoo-detoo.

                                     luke
                         hello.

               artoo beeps in response. luke unplugs artoo and begins to
               scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome
               pick. threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping
               oil from his bronze body.

                                     luke
                         you got a lot of carbon scoring here.
                         it looks like you boys have seen a
                         lot of action.

                                     threepio
                         with all we've been through, sometimes
                         i'm amazed we're in as good condition
                         as we are, what with the rebellion
                         and all.

                                     luke
                         you know of the rebellion against
                         the empire?

                                     threepio
                         that's how we came to be in your
                         service, if you take my meaning,
                         sir.

                                     luke
                         have you been in many battles?

                                     threepio
                         several, i think. actually, there's
                         not much to tell. i'm not much more
                         than an interpreter, and not very
                         good at telling stories. well, not
                         at making them interesting, anyways.

               luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from artoo's
               neck joint. he uses a larger pick.

                                     luke
                         well, my little friend, you've got
                         something jammed in here real good.
                         were you on a cruiser or...

               the fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending luke tumbling
               head over heels. he sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
               dimensional hologram of leia organa, the rebel senator, being
               projected from the face of little artoo. the image is a
               rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly
               lit garage. luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

                                     leia
                         help me, obi-wan kenobi. you're my
                         only hope.

                                     luke
                         what's this?

               artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for threepio
               to translate. leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment
               over and over.

                                     threepio
                         what is what?!? he asked you a
                         question...
                              (pointing to leia)
                         what is that?

               artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice
               the hologram. he looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer
               for threepio to translate. leia continues to repeat the
               sentence fragment over and over.

                                     leia
                         help me, obi-wan kenobi. you're my
                         only hope. help me, obi-wan kenobi.
                         you're my only hope.

                                     threepio
                         oh, he says it's nothing, sir. merely
                         a malfunction. old data. pay it no
                         mind.

               luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.

                                     luke
                         who is she? she's beautiful.

                                     threepio
                         i'm afraid i'm not quite sure, sir.

                                     leia
                         help me, obi-wan kenobi...

                                     threepio
                         i think she was a passenger on our
                         last voyage. a person of some
                         importance, sir -- i believe. our
                         captain was attached to...

                                     luke
                         is there more to this recording?

               luke reaches out for artoo but he lets out several frantic
               squeaks and a whistle.

                                     threepio
                         behave yourself, artoo. you're going
                         to get us in trouble. it's all right,
                         you can trust him. he's our new
                         master.

               artoo whistles and beeps a long message to threepio.

                                     threepio
                         he says he's the property of obi-wan
                         kenobi, a resident of these parts.
                         and it's a private message for him.
                         quite frankly, sir i don't know what
                         he's talking about. our last master
                         was captain antilles, but with what
                         we've been through, this little r2
                         unit has become a bit eccentric.

                                     luke
                         obi-wan kenobi? i wonder if he means
                         old ben kenobi?

                                     threepio
                         i beg your pardon, sir, but do you
                         know what he's talking about?

                                     luke
                         well, i don't know anyone named obi-
                         wan, but old ben lives out beyond
                         the dune sea. he's kind of a strange
                         old hermit.

               luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few
               moments.

                                     luke
                         i wonder who she is. it sounds like
                         she's in trouble. i'd better play
                         back the whole thing.

               artoo beeps something to threepio.

                                     threepio
                         he says the restraining bolt has
                         short circuited his recording system.
                         he suggests that if you remove the
                         bolt, he might be able to play back
                         the entire recording.

               luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't
               really heard what threepio has been saying.

                                     luke
                         h'm? oh, yeah, well, i guess you're
                         too small to run away on me if i
                         take this off! okay.

               luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off
               artoo's side.

                                     luke
                         there you go.

               the princess immediately disappears...

                                     luke
                         well, wait a minute. where'd she go?
                         bring her back! play back the entire
                         message.

               artoo beeps an innocent reply as threepio sits up in
               embarrassment.

                                     threepio
                         what message? the one you're carrying
                         inside your rusty innards!

               a women's voice calls out from another room.

                                     aunt beru
                         luke? luke! come to dinner!

               luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning
               robot.

                                     luke
                         all right, i'll be right there, aunt
                         beru.

                                     threepio
                         i'm sorry, sir, but he appears to
                         have picked up a slight flutter.

               luke tosses artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and
               hurries out of the room.

                                     luke
                         well, see what you can do with him.
                         i'll be right back.

                                     threepio
                              (to artoo)
                         just you reconsider playing that
                         message for him.

               artoo beeps in response.

                                     threepio
                         no, i don't think he likes you at
                         all.

               artoo beeps.

                                     threepio
                         no, i don't like you either.

               int. lars homestead - dining area

               luke's aunt beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher
               with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
               used kitchen. she puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls
               of food and starts for the dining area.

               luke sits with his uncle owen before a table covered with
               steaming bowls of food as aunt beru carries in a bowl of red
               grain.

                                     luke
                         you know, i think that r2 unit we
                         bought might have been stolen.

                                     owen
                         what makes you think that?

                                     luke
                         well, i stumbled across a recording
                         while i was cleaning him. he says he
                         belongs to someone called obi-wan
                         kenobi.

               owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but
               manages to control himself.

                                     luke
                         i thought he might have meant old
                         ben. do you know what he's talking
                         about? well, i wonder if he's related
                         to ben.

               owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.

                                     owen
                         that old man's just a crazy old
                         wizard. tomorrow i want you to take
                         that r2 unit into anchorhead and
                         have its memory flushed. that'll be
                         the end of it. it belongs to us now.

                                     luke
                         but what if this obi-wan comes looking
                         for him?

                                     owen
                         he won't, i don't think he exists
                         any more. he died about the same
                         time as your father.

                                     luke
                         he knew my father?

                                     owen
                         i told you to forget it. your only
                         concern is to prepare the new droids
                         for tomorrow. in the morning i want
                         them on the south ridge working out
                         those condensers.

                                     luke
                         yes, sir. i think those new droids
                         are going to work out fine. in fact,
                         i, uh, was also thinking about our
                         agreement about my staying on another
                         season. and if these new droids do
                         work out, i want to transmit my
                         application to the academy this year.

               owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress
               it.

                                     owen
                         you mean the next semester before
                         harvest?

                                     luke
                         sure, there're more than enough
                         droids.

                                     owen
                         harvest is when i need you the most.
                         only one more season. this year we'll
                         make enough on the harvest so i'll
                         be able to hire some more hands. and
                         then you can go to the academy next
                         year.

               luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.

                                     owen
                         you must understand i need you here,
                         luke.

                                     luke
                         but it's a whole 'nother year.

                                     owen
                         look, it's only one more season.

               luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.

                                     luke
                         yeah, that's what you said last year
                         when biggs and tank left.

                                     aunt beru
                         where are you going?

                                     luke
                         it looks like i'm going nowhere. i
                         have to finish cleaning those droids.

               resigned to his fate, luke paddles out of the room. owen
               mechanically finishes his dinner.

                                     aunt beru
                         owen, he can't stay here forever.
                         most of his friends have gone. it
                         means so much to him.

                                     owen
                         i'll make it up to him next year. i
                         promise.

                                     aunt beru
                         luke's just not a farmer, owen. he
                         has too much of his father in him.

                                     owen
                         that's what i'm afraid of.

               ext. tatooine - lars homestead

               the giant twin suns of tatooine slowly disappear behind a
               distant dune range. luke stands watching them for a few
               moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the
               homestead.

               int. lars homestead - garage

               luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in
               sight. he takes a small control box from his utility belt
               similar to the one the jawas were carrying. he activates the
               box, which creates a low hum, and threepio, letting out a
               short yell, pops up from behind the skyhopper spaceship.

                                     luke
                         what are you doing hiding there?

               threepio stumbles forward, but artoo is still nowhere in
               sight.

                                     threepio
                         it wasn't my fault, sir. please don't
                         deactivate me. i told him not to go,
                         but he's faulty, malfunctioning;
                         kept babbling on about his mission.

                                     luke
                         oh, no!

               luke races out of the garage followed by threepio.

               ext. tatooine - lars homestead

               luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead
               and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
               robot. threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the
               salt flat as luke scans the landscape with his
               electrobinoculars.

                                     threepio
                         that r2 unit has always been a
                         problem. these astro-droids are
                         getting quite out of hand. even i
                         can't understand their logic at times.

                                     luke
                         how could i be so stupid? he's nowhere
                         in sight. blast it!

                                     threepio
                         pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go
                         after him?

                                     luke
                         it's too dangerous with all the
                         sandpeople around. we'll have to
                         wait until morning.

               owen yells up from the homestead plaza.

                                     owen
                         luke, i'm shutting the power down
                         for the night.

                                     luke
                         all right, i'll be there in a few
                         minutes. boy, am i gonna get it.

               he takes one final look across the dim horizon.

                                     luke
                         you know that little droid is going
                         to cause me a lot of trouble.

                                     threepio
                         oh, he excels at that, sir.

               int. lars homestead - plaza

               morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of
               the open courtyard. the idyll is broken be the yelling of
               uncle owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.

                                     owen
                         luke? luke? luke? where could he be
                         loafing now!

               int. lars homestead - kitchen

               the interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as aunt beru
               prepares the morning breakfast. owen enters in a huff.

                                     owen
                         have you seen luke this morning?

                                     aunt beru
                         he said he had some things to do
                         before he started today, so he left
                         early.

                                     owen
                         uh? did he take those two new droids
                         with him?

                                     aunt beru
                         i think so.

                                     owen
                         well, he'd better have those units
                         in the south range repaired be midday
                         or there'll be hell to pay!

               ext. tatooine - desert wasteland - luke's speeder - day

               the rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as threepio
               pilots the sleek landspeeder gracefully across the vast
               wasteland.

               int./ext. luke's speeder - desert wasteland - traveling -
               day

               luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something
               in the motor compartment.

                                     luke
                              (yelling)
                         how's that.

               threepio signals that is fine and luke turns back into the
               wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.

                                     luke
                         old ben kenobi lives out in this
                         direction somewhere, but i don't see
                         how that r2 unit could have come
                         this far. we must have missed him.
                         uncle owen isn't going to take this
                         very well.

                                     threepio
                         sir, would it help if you told him
                         it was my fault.

                                     luke
                              (brightening)
                         sure. he needs you. he'd probably
                         only deactivate you for a day or
                         so...

                                     threepio
                         deactivate! well, on the other hand
                         if you hadn't removed his restraining
                         bolt...

                                     luke
                         wait, there's something dead ahead
                         on the scanner. it looks like our
                         droid... hit the accelerator.

               ext. tatooine - rock mesa - dune sea - coastline - day

               from high on a rock mesa, the tiny landspeeder can be seen
               gliding across the desert floor. suddenly in the foreground
               two weather-beaten sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert
               cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. one of the
               marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle
               and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs
               the gun before it can be fired.

               the sandpeople, or tusken raiders as they're sometimes called,
               speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an
               animated argument. the second tusken raider seems to get in
               the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.

               ext. tatooine - rock mesa - canyon

               the tusken raider approaches two large banthas standing tied
               to a rock. the monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large
               as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns,
               and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. the tusken raiders
               mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs
               and ride off down the rugged bluff.

               ext. tatooine - rock canyon - floor

               the speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. luke,
               with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands
               before little artoo.

                                     luke
                         hey, whoa, just where do you think
                         you're going?

               the little droid whistles a feeble reply, as threepio poses
               menacingly behind the little runaway.

                                     threepio
                         master luke here is your rightful
                         owner. we'll have no more of this
                         obi-wan kenobi jibberish... and don't
                         talk to me about your mission, either.
                         you're fortunate he doesn't blast
                         you into a million pieces right here.

                                     luke
                         well, come on. it's getting late. i
                         only hope we can get back before
                         uncle owen really blows up.

                                     threepio
                         if you don't mind my saying so, sir,
                         i think you should deactivate the
                         little fugitive until you've gotten
                         him back to your workshop.

                                     luke
                         no, he's not going to try anything.

               suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic
               whistles and screams.

                                     luke
                         what's wrong with him now?

                                     threepio
                         oh my... sir, he says there are
                         several creatures approaching from
                         the southeast.

               luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.

                                     luke
                         sandpeople! or worst! come on, let's
                         have a look. come on.

               ext. tatooine - rock canyon - ridge - day

               luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and
               scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. he spots the
               two riderless banthas. threepio struggles up behind the young
               adventurer.

                                     luke
                         there are two banthas down there but
                         i don't see any... wait a second,
                         they're sandpeople all right. i can
                         see one of them now.

               luke watches the distant tusken raider through his
               electrobinoculars. suddenly something huge moves in front of
               his field of view. before luke or threepio can react, a large,
               gruesome tusken raider looms over them. threepio is startled
               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. he can be
               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles
               down the side of the mountain.

               the towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed
               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in
               the heart of the local settlers. but luke manages to block
               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces.
               the terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced
               to the edge of a deep crevice. the sinister raider stands
               over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible
               shrieking laugh.

               ext. tatooine - rock canyon - floor - day

               artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in
               the rocks as the vicious sandpeople walk past carrying the
               inert luke skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the
               speeder.  the sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts
               and supplies in all directions. suddenly they stop. then
               everything is quiet for a few moments. a great howling moan
               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the
               sandpeople fleeing in terror.

               artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight
               swishing sound that frightened off the sandpeople grows even
               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and
               leans over luke. his ancient leathery face, cracked and
               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating
               eyes and a scraggly white beard. ben kenobi squints his eyes
               as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. artoo makes a
               slight sound and ben turns and looks right at him.

                                     ben
                         hello there! come here my little
                         friend. don't be afraid.

               artoo waddles over to were luke lies crumpled in a heap and
               begins to whistle and beep his concern. ben puts his hand on
               luke's forehead and he begins to come around.

                                     ben
                         don't worry, he'll be all right.

                                     luke
                         what happened?

                                     ben
                         rest easy, son, you've had a busy
                         day. you're fortunate you're still
                         in one piece.

                                     luke
                         ben? ben kenobi! boy, am i glad to
                         see you!

                                     ben
                         the jundland wastes are not to be
                         traveled lightly. tell me young luke,
                         what brings you out this far?

                                     luke
                         oh, this little droid! i think he's
                         searching for his former master...
                         i've never seen such devotion in a
                         droid before... there seems to be no
                         stopping him. he claims to be the
                         property of an obi-wan kenobi. is he
                         a relative of yours? do you know who
                         he's talking about?

               ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.

                                     ben
                         obi-wan kenobi... obi-wan? now thats
                         a name i haven't heard in a long
                         time... a long time.

                                     luke
                         i think my uncle knew him. he said
                         he was dead.

                                     ben
                         oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.

                                     luke
                         you know him!

                                     ben
                         well of course, of course i know
                         him. he's me! i haven't gone by the
                         name obi-wan since oh, before you
                         were born.

                                     luke
                         then the droid does belong to you.

                                     ben
                         don't seem to remember ever owning a
                         droid. very interesting...

               he suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.

                                     ben
                         i think we better get indoors. the
                         sandpeople are easily startled but
                         they will soon be back and in greater
                         numbers.

               luke sits up and rubs his head. artoo lets out a pathetic
               beep causing luke to remember something. he looks around.

                                     luke
                         threepio!

               ext. tatooine - sand pit - rock mesa - day

               little artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins
               to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. luke and
               ben stand over a very dented and tangled threepio lying half
               buried in the sand. one of his arms has broken off.

               luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then
               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally
               the mechanical man's systems turn on.

                                     threepio
                         where am i? i must have taken a bad
                         step...

                                     luke
                         can you stand? we've got to get out
                         of here before the sandpeople return.

                                     threepio
                         i don't think i can make it. you go
                         on, master luke. there's no sense in
                         you risking yourself on my account.
                         i'm done for.

               artoo makes a beeping sound.

                                     luke
                         no, you're not. what kind of talk is
                         that?

               luke and ben help the battered robot to his feet. little
               artoo watches from the top of the pit. ben glances around
               suspiciously. sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the
               air.

                                     ben
                         quickly, son... they're on the move.

               int. kenobi's dwelling

               the small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but
               still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and
               security. luke is in one corner repairing threepio's arm, as
               old ben sits thinking.

                                     luke
                         no, my father didn't fight in the
                         wars. he was a navigator on a spice
                         freighter.

                                     ben
                         that's what your uncle told you. he
                         didn't hold with your father's ideals.
                         thought he should have stayed here
                         and not gotten involved.

                                     luke
                         you fought in the clone wars?

                                     ben
                         yes, i was once a jedi knight the
                         same as your father.

                                     luke
                         i wish i'd known him.

                                     ben
                         he was the best star-pilot in the
                         galaxy, and a cunning warrior. i
                         understand you've become quite a
                         good pilot yourself. and he was a
                         good friend. which reminds me...

               ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.
               as luke finishes repairing threepio and starts to fit the
               restraining bolt back on, threepio looks at him nervously.
               luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the
               table. ben shuffles up and presents luke with a short handle
               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

                                     ben
                         i have something here for you. your
                         father wanted you to have this when
                         you were old enough, but your uncle
                         wouldn't allow it. he feared you
                         might follow old obi-wan on some
                         damned-fool idealistic crusade like
                         your father did.

                                     threepio
                         sir, if you'll not be needing me,
                         i'll close down for awhile.

                                     luke
                         sure, go ahead.

               ben hands luke the saber.

                                     luke
                         what is it?

                                     ben
                         your fathers lightsaber. this is the
                         weapon of a jedi knight. not as clumsy
                         or as random as a blaster.

               luke pushes a button on the handle. a long beam shoots out
               about four feet and flickers there. the light plays across
               the ceiling.

                                     ben
                         an elegant weapon for a more civilized
                         time. for over a thousand generations
                         the jedi knights were the guardians
                         of peace and justice in the old
                         republic. before the dark times,
                         before the empire.

               luke hasn't really been listening.

                                     luke
                         how did my father die?

                                     ben
                         a young jedi named darth vader, who
                         was a pupil of mine until he turned
                         to evil, helped the empire hunt down
                         and destroy the jedi knights. he
                         betrayed and murdered your father.
                         now the jedi are all but extinct.
                         vader was seduced by the dark side
                         of the force.

                                     luke
                         the force?

                                     ben
                         well, the force is what gives a jedi
                         his power. it's an energy field
                         created by all living things. it
                         surrounds us and penetrates us. it
                         binds the galaxy together.

               artoo makes beeping sounds.

                                     ben
                         now, let's see if we can't figure
                         out what you are, my little friend.
                         and where you come from.

                                     luke
                         i saw part of the message he was...

               luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful
               young rebel princess is projected from artoo's face.

                                     ben
                         i seem to have found it.

               luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before
               his eyes.

                                     leia
                         general kenobi, years ago you served
                         my father in the clone wars. now he
                         begs you to help him in his struggle
                         against the empire. i regret that i
                         am unable to present my father's
                         request to you in person, but my
                         ship has fallen under attack and i'm
                         afraid my mission to bring you to
                         alderaan has failed. i have placed
                         information vital to the survival of
                         the rebellion into the memory systems
                         of this r2 unit. my father will know
                         how to retrieve it. you must see
                         this droid safely delivered to him
                         on alderaan. this is our most
                         desperate hour. help me, obi-wan
                         kenobi, you're my only hope.

               there is a little static and the transmission is cut short.
               old ben leans back and scratches his head. he silently puffs
               on a tarnished chrome water pipe. luke has stars in his eyes.

                                     ben
                         you must learn the ways of the force
                         if you're to come with me to alderaan.

                                     luke
                              (laughing)
                         alderaan? i'm not going to alderaan.
                         i've got to go home. it's late, i'm
                         in for it as it is.

                                     ben
                         i need your help, luke. she needs
                         your help. i'm getting too old for
                         this sort of thing.

                                     luke
                         i can't get involved! i've got work
                         to do! it's not that i like the
                         empire. i hate it! but there's nothing
                         i can do about it right now. it's
                         such a long way from here.

                                     ben
                         that's your uncle talking.

                                     luke
                              (sighing)
                         oh, god, my uncle. how am i ever
                         going to explain this?

                                     ben
                         learn about the force, luke.

                                     luke
                         look, i can take you as far as
                         anchorhead. you can get a transport
                         there to mos eisley or wherever you're
                         going.

                                     ben
                         you must do what you feel is right,
                         of course.

               ext. space.

               an imperial stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like
               battle station: the death star!

               int. death star - conference room

               eight imperial senators and generals sit around a black
               conference table. imperial stormtroopers stand guard around
               the room. commander tagge, a young, slimy-looking general,
               is speaking.

                                     tagge
                         until this battle station is fully
                         operational we are vulnerable. the
                         rebel alliance is too well equipped.
                         they're more dangerous than you
                         realize.

               the bitter admiral motti twists nervously in his chair.

                                     motti
                         dangerous to your starfleet,
                         commander, not to this battle station!

                                     tagge
                         the rebellion will continue to gain
                         a support in the imperial senate as
                         long as....

               suddenly all heads turn as commander tagge's speech is cut
               short and the grand moff tarkin, governor of the imperial
               outland regions, enters. he is followed by his powerful ally,
               the sith lord, darth vader. all of the generals stand and
               bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his
               place at the head of the table. the dark lord stands behind
               him.

                                     tarkin
                         the imperial senate will no longer
                         be of any concern to us. i've just
                         received word that the emperor has
                         dissolved the council permanently.
                         the last remnants of the old republic
                         have been swept away.

                                     tagge
                         that's impossible! how will the
                         emperor maintain control without the
                         bureaucracy?

                                     tarkin
                         the regional governors now have direct
                         control over territories. fear will
                         keep the local systems in line. fear
                         of this battle station.

                                     tagge
                         and what of the rebellion? if the
                         rebels have obtained a complete
                         technical readout of this station,
                         it is possible, however unlikely,
                         that they might find a weakness and
                         exploit it.
